                    <p>
                        I work as an Onsite Support Analyst (IT Guy) for a B2B company. I’ve been doing this line of work since 2007. I’ve gotten to a point in my career where I want to do something different for a change. Still in I.T. but something different. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I remember when I first got my computer in 1994. I was so excited! it was a Packard Bell desktop with 8MB of RAM. It was during that time I discovered website design and created my first website via just HTML. There weren’t much going on with web design back then. It was purely just HTML. But throughout the years, i’ve gotten distant from it and eventually changed focus to what i’m doing right now - desktop support. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        A lot has changed since then. There is so much to learn now and it’s almost impossible to learn everything from this I.T. category than from 1994. It’s so vast that you can get lost and lose track of your objective and what you’re really trying to pursue. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It was early last year where I attempted to give Web Development another go at it. It was an uphill battle. I’ve gone through numerous online resources, online bootcamps, online video tutorials and eBooks in trying to learn everything I can about WebDev. I would get motivated at first but suddenly lose track either because the tutorials I was following weren’t detailed enough or the teacher wasn’t teaching properly. Here are all of the online bootcamps i’ve tried below:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Codecademy Pro</li>
                        <li>CareerFoundry</li>
                        <li>Treehouse</li>
                        <li>Udacity</li>
                        <li>Lynda</li>
                        <li>Udemy</li>
                        <li>Codeschool</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        I’m not saying these online bootcamps are rubbish. It’s just that, I feel you can’t apply a certain formula of teaching to someone and expect it to stick to them. I think each person requires a certain type of teaching style (well, for me, it does). It was early this year that I figured i’d access my paused Treehouse account and have a look and it’s where I discovered their Techdegree program. They were offering it for $99 as a Beta promo. After a few weeks of thinking, I finally decided last night (Sunday) to give it a shot. So join me on my journey to becoming a full fledge front-end web developer. I hope this time around, i’ll stay on track.
